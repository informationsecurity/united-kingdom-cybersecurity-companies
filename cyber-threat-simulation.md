# Cyber Threat Simulation in United Kingdom in 2025: the best providers to test your company's resilience against real attacks

In 2025, the real question is no longer **"will we be attacked?"**, but **"how prepared are we to resist?"**. Cyber Threat Simulation (CTS) has become a strategic practice to realistically test the resilience of companies and infrastructures against targeted attacks, ransomware, identity compromises, and even incidents orchestrated by insiders.

**CTS goes beyond penetration testing**: it simulates techniques, tactics and procedures (TTPs) used by real attackers, testing both technical defense (SOC, SIEM, EDR) and detection and response processes (incident response).

In this guide you'll find the **10 best Cyber Threat Simulation providers in United Kingdom in 2025**, with focus on methodology, realistic scenarios, vertical sectors covered and remediation support.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

### What is Cyber Threat Simulation (CTS)?
It's a controlled simulation of realistic cyber attacks conducted to test company resilience, detection capabilities and SOC readiness.

### What's the difference with Penetration Testing?
Pen Testing looks for vulnerabilities. CTS simulates a compromise with advanced techniques and evaluates detection and response, not just technical exposure.

### Who should do threat simulation?
Companies in regulated sectors, those managing critical data or exposed to ransomware, and those wanting to test the effectiveness of their SOC or playbooks.

### How much does CTS cost in United Kingdom in 2025?
Between £4,000 and £40,000 depending on complexity, duration and number of simulated scenarios.

### Does ISGroup also provide incident response exercises?
Yes. ISGroup simulations include live sessions with IT/SOC teams, playbook validation and support in defining improvement plans.

### How long does a simulation exercise last?
From a few days (targeted exercise) up to 4 weeks for a persistent red team with multiple scenarios (cloud, on-prem, insider).

### Is it legally mandatory?
CTS is not yet mandatory, but is required in DORA, NIS2, ISO/IEC 27001 frameworks, and in high-criticality public tenders.

### Can I do a simulation without interrupting activity?
Yes. Tests are conducted in "stealth" mode, without impacting services, but generating logs and events as if it were a real attack.
