# Software Assurance Lifecycle in United Kingdom in 2025: the best providers to ensure continuous security in the software lifecycle

In 2025, security cannot be a "post development" activity: it must be integrated into every phase of the **Software Development Lifecycle (SDLC)**. Reference frameworks (NIST SSDF, OWASP SAMM, ISO/IEC 27034), combined with regulations (NIS2, DORA, UK Cyber Security Framework), require structured approaches to **Software Assurance Lifecycle (SAL)**.

SAL enables:

- Integrate security into CI/CD, DevOps and codebase
- Identify early-stage vulnerabilities
- Automate security testing
- Reduce remediation costs and time
- Demonstrate technical compliance with regulations and frameworks

In this guide you'll find the **10 best UK providers for Software Assurance Lifecycle in 2025**, with focus on DevSecOps, code review, SAST/DAST, API security and secure software governance.
